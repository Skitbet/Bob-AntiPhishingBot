# About Bob

Bob is a small Discord bot that deletes all known phising links/scams (over 14k)
and will even delete suspicious links! This bot is open source and free to use to everyone.
I will not be providing a host for the bot!

# Configuration
This bot was not meant to be used for everyone is just a 
little thing I made to test. So there are no easy to use commands... 
but it can still be configured!

To configure the known phishing links list open the botconfig/domain-list.json

To configure the suspicious links list just open botconfig/sus-list.json
